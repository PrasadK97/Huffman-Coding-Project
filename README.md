# Huffman-Coding-Project
-Implemented a lossless data compression algorithm using Huffman coding in Python. Utilized data structures such as trees,
linked lists, and hashmaps to construct the variable-length codes based on character frequencies.
– Demonstrated proficiency in designing and developing the Huffman coding algorithm to achieve efficient data compression while
ensuring that the assigned codes are unambiguous during decoding.
– Successfully assigned variable-length codes as Prefix Codes, guaranteeing that no code assigned to one character serves as the
prefix for another character’s code, leading to a reliable and effective bitstream decoding process
